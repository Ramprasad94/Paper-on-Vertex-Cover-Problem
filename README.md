# Paper-on-Vertex-Cover-Problem
A repository containing the academic paper on the NP Complete Vertex Cover Problem

The NP-Complete Vertex Cover problem has been at the forefront of researchers' attention for many decades now. Our paper analyzes the 
multiple approaches used to solve it using approximation techniques, while simultaneously proposing our own novel solution using parallel
runs of BFS to find the articulation points. This approach can scale quite well on complex network graphs while retaining the same 
time complexity of O(V+E).
